/pst/Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; * shame hath covered my face.
/pst/I am become a stranger to my brethren, * and an alien to the sons of my mother.
/pst/For the zeal of thy house hath eaten me up: * and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.
/pst/And I covered my soul in fasting: * and it was made a reproach to me.
/pst/And I made haircloth my garment: * and I became a byword to them.
/pst/They that sat in the gate spoke against me: * and they that drank wine made me their song.
/pst/But as for me, my prayer is to thee, O Lord; * for the time of thy good pleasure, O God.
/pst/In the multitude of thy mercy hear me, * in the truth of thy salvation.
/pst/Draw me out of the mire, that I may not stick fast: * deliver me from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.
/pst/Let not the tempest of water drown me, nor the deep swallow me up: * and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.
/pst/Hear me, O Lord, for thy mercy is kind; * look upon me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.
/pst/And turn not away thy face from thy servant: * for I am in trouble, hear me speedily.
/pst/Attend to my soul, and deliver it: * save me because of my enemies.
/pst/Thou knowest my reproach, and my confusion, * and my shame.
/pst/In thy sight are all they that afflict me; * my heart hath expected reproach and misery.
/pst/And I looked for one that would grieve together with me, * but there was none: and for one that would comfort me, and I found none.
/pst/And they gave me gall for my food, * and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.
/pst/Let their table become as a snare before them, * and a recompense, and a stumblingblock.

/pst/Pour out thy indignation upon them: * and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them.
/pst/Let their habitation be made desolate: * and let there be none to dwell in their tabernacles.
/pst/Because they have persecuted him whom thou hast smitten; * and they have added to the grief of my wounds.

Weeping she hath wept in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks: there is none to comfort her among all them that were dear to her: all her friends have despised her, and are become her enemies. Ghimel. Juda hath removed her dwelling place because of her affliction, and the greatness of her bondage: she hath dwelt among the nations, and she hath found no rest: all her persecutors have taken her in the midst of straits. Daleth. The ways of Sion mourn, because there are none that come to the solemn feast: all her gates are broken down: her priests sigh: her virgins are in affliction, and she is oppressed with bitterness. He. Her adversaries are become her lords, her enemies are enriched: because the Lord hath spoken against her for the multitude of her iniquities: her children are led into captivity: before the face of the oppressor. Jerusalem, Jerusalem, return to the Lord thy God.

/ref/On Psalm liv, 1
/tralett/G[NJ]ive ear to my prayer, O God, and despise not my supplication: attend unto me and hear me. These are the words of a man travailing, anxious, and troubled. He prayeth in the midst of much suffering, longing to be rid of his affliction. Our part is to see what that his affliction was, and when he hath told us, to acknowledge that we also suffer therefrom; that so, partaking in his trouble, we may take part also in his exercise, and am troubled. Wherein mourned he? Wherein was he troubled? He saith: In my exercise. In the next words he giveth us to know that his affliction was the oppression of the wicked, because of the voice of the enemy, and because of the oppression of the wicked, and this suffering which came upon him at the hands of wicked men, he hath called his exercise. Think not that wicked men are in this world for nothing, or that God doth no good with them. Every wicked man liveth, either to repent, or to exercise the righteous.

Yet, while they are as they are, and exercise us, we will not hate them: for we know not of any one of them whether he will endure to the end in his sin. Yea, oftentimes, when thou deemest that thou hatest thine enemy, he whom thou hatest is thy brother, and thou knowest it not. The Holy Scriptures show us that the devil and his angels are already damned unto everlasting fire, and therefore of their repentance it behoveth us to despair; but of theirs only. These are they against whom we wrestle within; to the which wrestling the Apostle stirreth us up where he saith: We wrestle not against flesh and blood, (that is, not against men whom we see,) but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world. He saith not the rulers of this world, lest perchance thou shouldest deem that devils are the lords of heaven and earth; what he doth say is, rulers of the darkness of this world, of that world which they love who love the world, of that world wherein the ungodly and unrighteous do prosper, of that world, in fine, of which the Gospel saith: And the world knew Him not.

That Cross which was the object of the insults of God’s enemies, is established now above the brows of kings.

The enemies of God thought the Cross a meet object of insult and ridicule, yea, they stood before it, wagging their heads and saying: If He be the Son of God, let Him come down from the Cross! And He stretched forth His Hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people. If he is just which liveth by faith, he is unjust that hath not faith. Therefore where is written iniquity we may understand unbelief.

/tralett/F[NJ]or I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread. And giving thanks, broke, and said: Take ye, and eat: this is my body, which shall be delivered for you: this do for the commemoration of me. In like manner also the chalice, after he had supped, saying: This chalice is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as often as you shall drink, for the commemoration of me. For as often as you shall eat this bread, and drink the chalice, you shall show the death of the Lord, until he come.
/resp/Rep. Could ye not watch with Me one hour, ye that called one on the other to die for Me? * Or see ye not Judas, how that he sleepeth not, but maketh haste to betray Me to the Jews? v Why sleep ye? Rise, and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. r Or see ye not Judas, how that he sleepeth not, but maketh haste to betray Me to the Jews?

/ref/Cor 11:27-34
/tralett/T[NJ]herefore whosoever shall eat this bread, or drink the chalice of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and of the blood of the Lord. But let a man prove himself: and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of the chalice. For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh judgment to himself, not discerning the body of the Lord. Therefore are there many infirm and weak among you, and many sleep. But if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. But whilst we are judged, we are chastised by the Lord, that we be not condemned with this world. Wherefore, my brethren, when you come together to eat, wait for one another. If any man be hungry, let him eat at home; that you come not together unto judgment. And the rest I will set in order, when I come.
/resp/Rep. The elders of the people consulted * That they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill Him they came out, as against a thief, with swords and staves. v The chief Priests and the Pharisees gathered a council. r That they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill Him: they came out, as against a thief, with swords and staves. r The elders of the people consulted * That they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill Him: they came out, as against a thief, with swords and staves.

/stt/Psalm 50
/pst1/Have mercy on me, O God, * according to thy great mercy.
/pst/And according to the multitude of thy tender mercies * blot out my iniquity.
/pst/Wash me yet more from my iniquity, * and cleanse me from my sin.
/pst/For I know my iniquity, * and my sin is always before me.
/pst/To thee only have I sinned, and have done evil before thee: * that thou mayst be justified in thy words, and mayst overcome when thou art judged.
/pst/For behold I was conceived in iniquities; * and in sins did my mother conceive me.
/pst/For behold thou hast loved truth: * the uncertain and hidden things of thy wisdom thou hast made manifest to me.
/pst/Thou shalt sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be cleansed: * thou shalt wash me, and I shall be made whiter than snow.
/pst/To my hearing thou shalt give joy and gladness: * and the bones that have been humbled shall rejoice.
/pst/Turn away thy face from my sins, * and blot out all my iniquities.
/pst/Create a clean heart in me, O God: * and renew a right spirit within my bowels.
/pst/Cast me not away from thy face; * and take not thy holy spirit from me.
/pst/Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation, * and strengthen me with a perfect spirit.
/pst/I will teach the unjust thy ways: * and the wicked shall be converted to thee.
/pst/Deliver me from blood, O God, thou God of my salvation: * and my tongue shall extol thy justice.
/pst/O Lord, thou wilt open my lips: * and my mouth shall declare thy praise.
/pst/For if thou hadst desired sacrifice, I would indeed have given it: * with burnt offerings thou wilt not be delighted.
/pst/A sacrifice to God is an afflicted spirit: * a contrite and humbled heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.
/pst/Deal favourably, O Lord, in thy good will with Sion; * that the walls of Jerusalem may be built up.
/pst/Then shalt thou accept the sacrifice of justice, oblations and whole burnt offerings: * then shall they lay calves upon thy altar.
/tra/Ant. O Lord, Thou shalt be justified when Thou speakest, and be clear when Thou art judged.

/pst1/Lord, thou hast been our refuge * from generation to generation.
/pst/Before the mountains were made, or the earth and the world was formed; * from eternity and to eternity thou art God.
/pst/Turn not man away to be brought low: * and thou hast said: Be converted, O ye sons of men.
/pst/For a thousand years in thy sight * are as yesterday, which is past.
/pst/And as a watch in the night, * things that are counted nothing, shall their years be.
/pst/In the morning man shall grow up like grass; in the morning he shall flourish and pass away: * in the evening he shall fall, grow dry, and wither.
/pst/For in thy wrath we have fainted away: * and are troubled in thy indignation.
/pst/Thou hast set our iniquities before thy eyes: * our life in the light of thy countenance.
/pst/For all our days are spent; * and in thy wrath we have fainted away.
/pst/Our years shall be considered as a spider: * the days of our years in them are threescore and ten years.
/pst/But if in the strong they be fourscore years: * and what is more of them is labour and sorrow.
/pst/For mildness is come upon us: * and we shall be corrected.
/pst/Who knoweth the power of thy anger, * and for thy fear can number thy wrath?
/pst/So make thy right hand known: * and men learned in heart, in wisdom.
/pst/Return, O Lord, how long? * and be entreated in favour of thy servants.
/pst/We are filled in the morning with thy mercy: * and we have rejoiced, and are delighted all our days.
/pst/We have rejoiced for the days in which thou hast humbled us: * for the years in which we have seen evils.
/pst/Look upon thy servants and upon their works: * and direct their children.
/pst/And let the brightness of the Lord our God be upon us: and direct thou the works of our hands over us; * yea, the work of our hands do thou direct.
/tra/Ant. The Lord was brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and He opened not His mouth.

/tra/Ant. Mine heart is broken within me * all my bones tremble.
/stt/Psalm 35
/pst1/The unjust hath said within himself, that he would sin: * there is no fear of God before his eyes.
/pst/For in his sight he hath done deceitfully, * that his iniquity may be found unto hatred.
/pst/The words of his mouth are iniquity and guile: * he would not understand that he might do well.
/pst/He hath devised iniquity on his bed, * he hath set himself on every way that is not good: but evil he hath not hated.
/pst/O Lord, thy mercy is in heaven, * and thy truth reacheth even to the clouds.
/pst/Thy justice is as the mountains of God, * thy judgments are a great deep.
/pst/Men and beasts thou wilt preserve, O Lord: * O how hast thou multiplied thy mercy, O God!
/pst/But the children of men * shall put their trust under the covert of thy wings.
/pst/They shall be inebriated with the plenty of thy house; * and thou shalt make them drink of the torrent of thy pleasure.
/pst/For with thee is the fountain of life; * and in thy light we shall see light.
/pst/Extend thy mercy to them that know thee, * and thy justice to them that are right in heart.
/pst/Let not the foot of pride come to me, * and let not the hand of the sinner move me.
/pst/There the workers of iniquity are fallen, * they are cast out, and could not stand.

/pst/He is my God and I will glorify him: * the God of my father, and I will exalt him.

/pst/His chosen captains are drowned in the Red Sea. * The depths have covered them, they are sunk to the bottom like a stone.
/pst/Thy right hand, O Lord, is magnified in strength: thy right hand, O Lord, hath slain the enemy. * And in the multitude of thy glory thou hast put down thy adversaries:
/pst/Thou hast sent thy wrath, which hath devoured them like stubble. * And with the blast of thy anger the waters were gathered together:
/pst/The flowing water stood, * the depths were gathered together in the midst of the sea.
/pst/The enemy said: I will pursue and overtake, * I will divide the spoils, my soul shall have its fill:
/pst/I will draw my sword, * my hand shall slay them.
/pst/Thy wind blew and the sea covered them: * they sunk as lead in the mighty waters.
/pst/Who is like to thee, among the strong, O Lord? * who is like to thee, glorious in holiness, terrible and praiseworthy, doing wonders?
/pst/Thou stretchedst forth thy hand, and the earth swallowed them. * In thy mercy thou hast been a leader to the people which thou hast redeemed:
/pst/And in thy strength thou hast carried them * to thy holy habitation.
/pst/Nations rose up, and were angry: * sorrows took hold on the inhabitants of Philisthiim.
/pst/Then were the princes of Edom troubled, trembling seized on the stout men of Moab: * all the inhabitants of Chanaan became stiff.
/pst/Let fear and dread fall upon them, * in the greatness of thy arm:
/pst/Let them become unmoveable as a stone, until thy people, O Lord, pass by: * until this thy people pass by, which thou hast possessed.
/pst/Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thy inheritance, * in thy most firm habitation which thou hast made, O Lord;
/pst/Thy sanctuary, O Lord, which thy hands have, established. * The Lord shall reign for ever and ever.
/pst/For Pharao went in on horseback with his chariots and horsemen into the sea: * and the Lord brought back upon them the waters of the sea:
/pst/But the children of Israel walked on dry ground * in the midst thereof.
