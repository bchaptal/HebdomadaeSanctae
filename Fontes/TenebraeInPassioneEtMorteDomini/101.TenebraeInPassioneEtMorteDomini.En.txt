/stt/From the Treatise of St. Augustine, Bishop of Hippo, Upon the Psalms
/ref/On Psalm LXIII, 2
/tralett/Thou hast hidden me from the secret counsel of the wicked, from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity. Now let us fix our eyes upon our Head. Many martyrs have. suffered such things as He suffered, but God’s hiding of His suffering servants is not so well seen in the Martyrs, as it is in the Captain of the Martyrs. And it is in Him that we best see how it fared with them. He was hidden from the secret counsel of the wicked; hidden by God, being Himself God; hidden, as touching the Manhood, by God the Son, and the very Manhood, Which is taken into God the Son; because He is the Son of man, and He is the Son of God; Son of God, as being in the form of God; Son of man, as having taken upon Him the form of a servant. Whose life no man taketh from Him, but Who layeth it down of Himself. He hath power to lay it down, and He hath power to take it again. What then was all that they which hated Him could do? They could kill the Body, but they were not able to kill the Soul. Consider this very earnestly. It had been a small thing for the Lord to preach to the Martyrs by His word, if He had not also nerved them by His example.
/resp/Rep. Are ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves, for to take Me? * I sat daily with you, teaching in the Temple, and ye laid no hold on Me; and, now when ye have scourged Me, ye lead Me away to crucify Me! v And when they had laid hands on Jesus, and taken Him, He said unto them: r I sat daily with you, teaching in the Temple, and ye laid no hold on Me; and now, when ye have scourged Me, ye lead Me away to crucify Me!
/stt/Reading 5
/tralett/We know what secret counsel was that of the wicked Jews, and what insurrection was that of the workers of iniquity. Of what iniquity were they the workers? The murder of our Lord Jesus Christ. Many good works, saith He, have I showed you for which of those works go ye about to kill Me? He had borne with all their weaknesses: He had healed all their diseases: He had preached unto them the kingdom of heaven: He had discovered to them their iniquities, that they might rather hate them, than the Physician That came to cure them. And now at last, without gratitude for all the tenderness of His healing love, like men raging in an high delirium, throwing themselves madly on the Physician, Who had come to cure them, they took counsel together how they might kill Him, as if to see if He were a Man and could die, or Something more than a man, and That would not let Himself die. In the Wisdom of Solomon we recognize their words, ii. 18, 19, 20, Let us condemn Him with a shameful death. Let us examine Him; for, by His own saying, He shall be respected. If He be the Son of God, let Him help Him.
/resp/Rep. The Jews crucified Jesus: and there was darkness (over all the land, unto the ninth hour): and about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, (saying): My God, (My God,) why hast Thou forsaken Me? * And He bowed His Head, and gave up the Ghost. v When Jesus had cried with a loud voice, He said: Father, into thy hands I commend My Spirit. r And He bowed His Head, and gave up the Ghost.

/tralett/They whetted their tongue like a sword. The Jews cannot say: We did not murder Christ, albeit they gave Him over to Pilate His judge, that they themselves might seem free of His death. For when Pilate said unto them, Take ye Him: and kill Him, they answered, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death. They could throw the blame of their sin upon a human judge: but did they deceive God, the Great Judge? In that which Pilate did, he was their accomplice, but in comparison with them, he had far the lesser sin. Pilate strove as far as he could, to deliver Him out of their hands; for the which reason also he scourged Him, and brought Him forth to them He scourged not the Lord for cruelty’s sake, but in the hope that; he might so slake their wild thirst for blood: that, perchance, even they might be touched with compassion, and cease to lust for His death, when they saw What He was after the flagellation. Even this effort he made! But when Pilate saw that he could not prevail, but that rather a tumult was made, ye know how that he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying: I am innocent of the blood of this Just Person. And yet he delivered Him to be crucified! But if he were guilty who did it against his will, were they innocent; who goaded him on to it? No. Pilate gave sentence against Him. and commanded Him to be crucified. But ye, O ye Jews, ye also are His murderers! Wherewith? With your tongue, whetted like a sword. And when? But when ye cried, Crucify Him! Crucify Him!

They have turned me over into the hands of the wicked: they also have numbered me with the transgressors, neither have they spared my life: the mighty are gathered together against me; * And stand up against me like giants. v Strangers are risen up against me, and oppressors seek after my soul. r And stand up against me like giants.

/ref/Heb 4:16; 5:1-3
/tralett/Let us go therefore with confidence to the throne of grace: that we may obtain mercy, and find grace in seasonable aid. For every high priest taken from among men, is ordained for men in the things that appertain to God, that he may offer up gifts and sacrifices for sins: Who can have compassion on them that are ignorant and that err: because he himself also is compassed with infirmity. And therefore he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.
/resp/Rep. That wicked one betrayed Jesus to the chief-priests and elders of the people * But Peter followed Him afar off, to see the end. v And they led Him away to Caiaphas the High Priest, where the Scribes and Pharisees were assembled. r But Peter followed Him afar off, to see the end.

/ref/Heb 5:4-10
/tralett/Neither doth any man take the honour to himself, but he that is called by God, as Aaron was. So Christ also did not glorify himself, that he might be made a high priest: but he that said unto him: Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee. As he saith also in another place: Thou art a priest for ever, according to the order of Melchisedech. Who in the days of his flesh, with a strong cry and tears, offering up prayers and supplications to him that was able to save him from death, was heard for his reverence. And whereas indeed he was the Son of God, he learned obedience by the things which he suffered: And being consummated, he became, to all that obey him, the cause of eternal salvation. Called by God a high priest according to the order of Melchisedech.
/resp/Rep. Mine eyes do fail with tears, because the Comforter that should relieve me is far from me. Behold, O all ye nations * If there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow. v O all ye that pass by, behold, and see. r If there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow. r Mine eyes do fail with tears, because the Comforter that should relieve me is far from me. Behold, O all ye nations, * If there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow.

/stt/Psalm 50
/pst1/Have mercy on me, O God, * according to thy great mercy.
/pst/And according to the multitude of thy tender mercies * blot out my iniquity.
/pst/Wash me yet more from my iniquity, * and cleanse me from my sin.
/pst/For I know my iniquity, * and my sin is always before me.
/pst/To thee only have I sinned, and have done evil before thee: * that thou mayst be justified in thy words, and mayst overcome when thou art judged.
/pst/For behold I was conceived in iniquities; * and in sins did my mother conceive me.
/pst/For behold thou hast loved truth: * the uncertain and hidden things of thy wisdom thou hast made manifest to me.
/pst/Thou shalt sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be cleansed: * thou shalt wash me, and I shall be made whiter than snow.
/pst/To my hearing thou shalt give joy and gladness: * and the bones that have been humbled shall rejoice.
/pst/Turn away thy face from my sins, * and blot out all my iniquities.
/pst/Create a clean heart in me, O God: * and renew a right spirit within my bowels.
/pst/Cast me not away from thy face; * and take not thy holy spirit from me.
/pst/Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation, * and strengthen me with a perfect spirit.
/pst/I will teach the unjust thy ways: * and the wicked shall be converted to thee.
/pst/Deliver me from blood, O God, thou God of my salvation: * and my tongue shall extol thy justice.
/pst/O Lord, thou wilt open my lips: * and my mouth shall declare thy praise.
/pst/For if thou hadst desired sacrifice, I would indeed have given it: * with burnt offerings thou wilt not be delighted.
/pst/A sacrifice to God is an afflicted spirit: * a contrite and humbled heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.
/pst/Deal favourably, O Lord, in thy good will with Sion; * that the walls of Jerusalem may be built up.
/pst/Then shalt thou accept the sacrifice of justice, oblations and whole burnt offerings: * then shall they lay calves upon thy altar.
/tra/Ant. God spared not His Own Son but delivered Him up for us all.

/pst1/Hear, O Lord, my prayer: give ear to my supplication in thy truth: * hear me in thy justice.
/pst/And enter not into judgment with thy servant: * for in thy sight no man living shall be justified.
/pst/For the enemy hath persecuted my soul: * he hath brought down my life to the earth.
/pst/He hath made me to dwell in darkness as those that have been dead of old: * and my spirit is in anguish within me: my heart within me is troubled.
/pst/I remembered the days of old, I meditated on all thy works: * I meditated upon the works of thy hands.
/pst/I stretched forth my hands to thee: * my soul is as earth without water unto thee.
/pst/Hear me speedily, O Lord: * my spirit hath fainted away.
/pst/Turn not away thy face from me, * lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit.
/pst/Cause me to hear thy mercy in the morning; * for in thee have I hoped.
/pst/Make the way known to me, wherein I should walk: * for I have lifted up my soul to thee.
/pst/Deliver me from my enemies, O Lord, to thee have I fled: * teach me to do thy will, for thou art my God.
/pst/Thy good spirit shall lead me into the right land: * for thy name’s sake, O Lord, thou wilt quicken me in thy justice.
/pst/Thou wilt bring my soul out of trouble: * and in thy mercy thou wilt destroy my enemies.
/pst/And thou wilt cut off all them that afflict my soul: * for I am thy servant.
/tra/Ant. My spirit is overwhelmed within me; my heart within me is troubled.

/pst/Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people: * thou hast covered all their sins.
/pst/Thou hast mitigated all thy anger: * thou hast turned away from the wrath of thy indignation.
/pst/Convert us, O God our saviour: * and turn off thy anger from us.
/pst/Wilt thou be angry with us for ever: * or wilt thou extend thy wrath from generation to generation?
/pst/Thou wilt turn, O God, and bring us to life: * and thy people shall rejoice in thee.
/pst/Shew us, O Lord, thy mercy; * and grant us thy salvation.
/pst/I will hear what the Lord God will speak in me: * for he will speak peace
/pst/And unto his saints: * and unto them that are converted to the heart.
/pst/Surely his salvation is near to them that fear him: * that glory may dwell in our land.
/pst/Mercy and truth have met each other: * justice and peace have kissed.
/pst/Truth is sprung out of the earth: * and justice hath looked down from heaven.
/pst/For the Lord will give goodness: * and our earth shall yield her fruit.
/pst/Justice shall walk before him: * and shall set his steps in the way.

/pst/O Lord, thy work, * in the midst of the years bring it to life:
/pst/In the midst of the years thou shalt make it known: * when thou art angry, thou wilt remember mercy.
/pst/God will come from the south, * and the holy one from mount Pharan:

/pst/His brightness shall be as the light: * horns are in his hands:
/pst/There is his strength hid: * Death shall go before his face.
/pst/And the devil shall go forth before his feet. * He stood and measured the earth.
/pst/He beheld, and melted the nations: * and the ancient mountains were crushed to pieces.
/pst/The hills of the world were bowed down * by the journeys of his eternity.
/pst/I saw the tents of Ethiopia for their iniquity, * the curtains of the land of Madian shall be troubled.
/pst/Wast thou angry, O Lord, with the rivers? * or was thy wrath upon the rivers? or thy indignation in the sea?
/pst/Who will ride upon thy horses: * and thy chariots are salvation.
/pst/Thou wilt surely take up thy bow: * according to the oaths which thou hast spoken to the tribes.
/pst/Thou wilt divide the rivers of the earth. The mountains saw thee, and were grieved: * the great body of waters passed away.
/pst/The deep put forth its voice: * the deep lifted up its hands.
/pst/The sun and the moon stood still in their habitation, * in the light of thy arrows, they shall go in the brightness of thy glittering spear.
/pst/In thy anger thou wilt tread the earth under foot: * in thy wrath thou wilt astonish the nations.
/pst/Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people: * for salvation with thy Christ.
/pst/Thou struckest the head of the house of the wicked: * thou hast laid bare his foundation even to the neck.
/pst/Thou hast cursed his sceptres, the head of his warriors, * them that came out as a whirlwind to scatter me.
/pst/Their joy * was like that of him that devoureth the poor man in secret.
/pst/Thou madest a way in the sea for thy horses, * in the mud of many waters.
/pst/I have heard and my bowels were troubled: * my lips trembled at the voice.
/pst/Let rottenness enter into my bones, * and swarm under me.
/pst/That I may rest in the day of tribulation: * that I may go up to our people that are girded.
/pst/For the fig tree shall not blossom: * and there shall be no spring in the vines.
/pst/The labour of the olive tree shall fail: * and the fields shall yield no food:
/pst/The flock shall be cut off from the fold, * and there shall be no herd in the stalls.
/pst/But I will rejoice in the Lord: * and I will joy in God my Jesus.
/pst/The Lord God is my strength: * and he will make my feet like the feet of harts:
/pst/And he the conqueror will lead me upon my high places * singing psalms.
