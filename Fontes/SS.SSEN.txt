/ref/On Psalm lxiii, 7
/tralett/W[NJ]e shall attain to thoughts that are very deep: but God shall still be exalted. The enemies of our Lord had communed of laying snares privily; they had said, Who shall see them? They had searched out iniquities; they had accomplished a diligent search. And Man attained even unto (the realization of) their counsels, for the Lord, as Man, suffered Himself to be taken. For He had not been taken at all, unless He had been a Man, or seen, unless He had been a Man, or smitten, unless He had been a Man, or crucified, unless He had been a Man, or have died, unless He had been a Man. Man therefore, He attained unto all those sufferings, which had had nothing in Him, unless He had been a Man. But if He had not been Man, man had not been redeemed. And the Lord as Man attained to thoughts that were very deep, yea, secret; showing the Manhood to the eyes of men, and keeping the Godhead within Him; veiling the form of God, as touching Which, He is Equal to the Father, and manifesting the form of a servant, as touching which, He is inferior to the Father.

For they said unto Pilate: Sir, we remember that that deceiver Matth. xxvii. 63. This was the term by which they designated the Lord Jesus Christ, and the remembrance that He was so named is a sweet consolation to us His servants, when we are called impostors. So they said unto Pilate, that deceiver said, while He was yet alive: After three days I will rise again. Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest His disciples come and steal Him away, and say unto the people: He is risen again from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first. Pilate said unto them: Ye have a watch; go your way; make it as sure as ye can. So they went and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch.

/tralett/S[NJ]o they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch and anon, behold, there was a great earthquake, and the Lord arose. So great wonders were wrought about the sepulchre that the very soldiers, which were put to guard it, were witnesses thereto, if only they would have told the truth. But the same love of money which had made a slave of that disciple who was a companion of Christ, made slaves also of the soldiers that were put to watch His sepulchre. Some of the watch came into the city, and showed unto the chief-priests all the things that were done: and when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers, saying: Say ye, His disciples came by night and stole Him away while we slept. In good sooth, their diligent search had been accomplished and ended before this. What didst thou say, O stupid cunning? Wast thou indeed so utterly void of the light of godly wisdom, and confounded in the bottomless pit of thine own falsehood as to tell them to say: His disciples came by night, and stole Him away while we slept? Part of the testimony of thine eye-witnesses was that they were asleep at the time: thou thyself wast asleep not to be able to see that on their own testimony, their testimony must have been worthless.

/pst/O Lord, if man’s life be such, and the life of my spirit be in such things as these, thou shalt correct me, and make me to live. * Behold in peace is my bitterness most bitter:
/pst/But thou hast delivered my soul that it should not perish, * thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back.
/pst/For hell shall not confess to thee, neither shall death praise thee: * nor shall they that go down into the pit, look for thy truth.
/pst/The living, the living, he shall give praise to thee, as I do this day: * the father shall make thy truth known to the children.
/pst/O Lord, save me, and we will sing our psalms all the days of our life * in the house of the Lord.
/tra/Ant. O Lord, deliver my soul from the gates of the grave.
/tra/Ant. O all ye that pass by * behold, and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow.
/stt/Psalm 150
/pst1/Praise ye the Lord in his holy places: * praise ye him in the firmament of his power.
/pst/Praise ye him for his mighty acts: * praise ye him according to the multitude of his greatness.
/pst/Praise him with sound of trumpet: * praise him with psaltery and harp.
/pst/Praise him with timbrel and choir: * praise him with strings and organs.
/pst/Praise him on high sounding cymbals: praise him on cymbals of joy: * let every spirit praise the Lord.
/tra/Ant. O all ye that pass by behold, and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow.
/tra/v My flesh shall rest in hope.
/tra/r Neither wilt Thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.
/tra/Ant. There were women sitting over against the sepulchre * weeping, and making lamentation for the Lord.
/stt/Canticle of Zacharias
/ref/Luke 1:68-79
/pst1/Blessed be the Lord ? God of Israel; * because he hath visited and wrought the redemption of his people:
/pst/And hath raised up an horn of salvation to us, * in the house of David his servant:
/pst/As he spoke by the mouth of his holy Prophets, * who are from the beginning:
/pst/Salvation from our enemies, * and from the hand of all that hate us:
/pst/To perform mercy to our fathers, * and to remember his holy testament,
/pst/The oath, which he swore to Abraham our father, * that he would grant to us,
/pst/That being delivered from the hand of our enemies, * we may serve him without fear,
/pst/In holiness and justice before him, * all our days.
/pst/And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: * for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways:
/pst/To give knowledge of salvation to his people, * unto the remission of their sins:
/pst/Through the bowels of the mercy of our God, * in which the Orient from on high hath visited us:
/pst/To enlighten them that sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death: * to direct our feet into the way of peace.
/tra/Ant. There were women sitting over against the sepulchre weeping, and making lamentation for the Lord.
