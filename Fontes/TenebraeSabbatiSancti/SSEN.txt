/ref/On Psalm lxiii, 7
/tralett/We shall attain to thoughts that are very deep: but God shall still be exalted. The enemies of our Lord had communed of laying snares privily; they had said, Who shall see them? They had searched out iniquities; they had accomplished a diligent search. And Man attained even unto (the realization of) their counsels, for the Lord, as Man, suffered Himself to be taken. For He had not been taken at all, unless He had been a Man, or seen, unless He had been a Man, or smitten, unless He had been a Man, or crucified, unless He had been a Man, or have died, unless He had been a Man. Man therefore, He attained unto all those sufferings, which had had nothing in Him, unless He had been a Man. But if He had not been Man, man had not been redeemed. And the Lord as Man attained to thoughts that were very deep, yea, secret; showing the Manhood to the eyes of men, and keeping the Godhead within Him; veiling the form of God, as touching Which, He is Equal to the Father, and manifesting the form of a servant, as touching which, He is inferior to the Father.
/tra/Resp. Our Shepherd, even the Fountain of living waters, is gone from us; He passed away, and the sun was darkened. <v>\greheightstar</v> For now hath our Saviour bound him captive, which bound the first man captive; this day hath He burst the gates and bars of death. v The bands of hell He hath utterly abolished, and hath done away the power of the devil. r For now hath our Saviour bound him captive, which bound the first man captive; this day hath He burst the gates and bars of death.

/tralett/How far did the accomplishment of their diligent search reach? Even to the setting a watch of soldiers at the sepulchre, to guard the Lord, even after He was dead and buried. For they said unto Pilate: Sir, we remember that that deceiver Matth. xxvii. 63. This was the term by which they designated the Lord Jesus Christ, and the remembrance that He was so named is a sweet consolation to us His servants, when we are called impostors. So they said unto Pilate, that deceiver said, while He was yet alive: After three days I will rise again. Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest His disciples come and steal Him away, and say unto the people: He is risen again from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first. Pilate said unto them: Ye have a watch; go your way; make it as sure as ye can. So they went and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch.
/tra/Resp. O all ye that pass by, behold and see; <v>\greheightstar</v> If there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow. v O all ye nations, behold, and see my sorrow, r If there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow.

So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch and anon, behold, there was a great earthquake, and the Lord arose. So great wonders were wrought about the sepulchre that the very soldiers, which were put to guard it, were witnesses thereto, if only they would have told the truth. But the same love of money which had made a slave of that disciple who was a companion of Christ, made slaves also of the soldiers that were put to watch His sepulchre. Some of the watch came into the city, and showed unto the chief-priests all the things that were done: and when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers, saying: Say ye, His disciples came by night and stole Him away while we slept. In good sooth, their diligent search had been accomplished and ended before this. What didst thou say, O stupid cunning? Wast thou indeed so utterly void of the light of godly wisdom, and confounded in the bottomless pit of thine own falsehood as to tell them to say: His disciples came by night, and stole Him away while we slept? Part of the testimony of thine eye-witnesses was that they were asleep at the time: thou thyself wast asleep not to be able to see that on their own testimony, their testimony must have been worthless.

/pst/I will teach the unjust thy ways: <v>\greheightstar</v> and the wicked shall be converted to thee.
/pst/Deliver me from blood, O God, thou God of my salvation: <v>\greheightstar</v> and my tongue shall extol thy justice.
/pst/O Lord, thou wilt open my lips: <v>\greheightstar</v> and my mouth shall declare thy praise.
/pst/For if thou hadst desired sacrifice, I would indeed have given it: <v>\greheightstar</v> with burnt offerings thou wilt not be delighted.
/pst/A sacrifice to God is an afflicted spirit: <v>\greheightstar</v> a contrite and humbled heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.
/pst/Deal favourably, O Lord, in thy good will with Sion; <v>\greheightstar</v> that the walls of Jerusalem may be built up.
/pst/Then shalt thou accept the sacrifice of justice, oblations and whole burnt offerings: <v>\greheightstar</v> then shall they lay calves upon thy altar.
/tra/Ant. O death, I will be thy death; O grave, I will be thy destruction.
/tra/Ant. They shall mourn for Him <v>\greheightstar</v> as one mourneth for his only son, for the innocent Lord hath been put to death.
/sttps/Psalm 91
/pst/It is good to give praise to the Lord: <v>\greheightstar</v> and to sing to thy name, O most High.
/pst/To shew forth thy mercy in the morning, <v>\greheightstar</v> and thy truth in the night:
/pst/Upon an instrument of ten strings, upon the psaltery: <v>\greheightstar</v> with a canticle upon the harp.
/pst/For thou hast given me, O Lord, a delight in thy doings: <v>\greheightstar</v> and in the works of thy hands I shall rejoice.
/pst/O Lord, how great are thy works! <v>\greheightstar</v> thy thoughts are exceeding deep.
/pst/The senseless man shall not know: <v>\greheightstar</v> nor will the fool understand these things.
/pst/When the wicked shall spring up as grass: <v>\greheightstar</v> and all the workers of iniquity shall appear:
/pst/That they may perish for ever and ever: <v>\greheightstar</v> but thou, O Lord, art most high for evermore.
/pst/For behold thy enemies, O Lord, for behold thy enemies shall perish: <v>\greheightstar</v> and all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.
/pst/But my horn shall be exalted like that of the unicorn: <v>\greheightstar</v> and my old age in plentiful mercy.
/pst/My eye also hath looked down upon my enemies: <v>\greheightstar</v> and my ear shall hear of the downfall of the malignant that rise up against me.
/pst/The just shall flourish like the palm tree: <v>\greheightstar</v> he shall grow up like the cedar of Libanus.
/pst/They that are planted in the house of the Lord <v>\greheightstar</v> shall flourish in the courts of the house of our God.
/pst/They shall still increase in a fruitful old age: <v>\greheightstar</v> and shall be well treated, that they may shew,
/pst/That the Lord our God is righteous, <v>\greheightstar</v> and there is no iniquity in him.
/tra/Ant. They shall mourn for Him as one mourneth for his only son, for the innocent Lord hath been put to death.
/tra/Ant. O all ye nations, behold <v>\greheightstar</v> and see my sorrow.
/sttps/Psalm 63
/pst/Hear, O God, my prayer, when I make supplication to thee: <v>\greheightstar</v> deliver my soul from the fear of the enemy.
/pst/Thou hast protected me from the assembly of the malignant; <v>\greheightstar</v> from the multitude of the workers of iniquity.
/pst/For they have whetted their tongues like a sword; <v>\greheightstar</v> they have bent their bow a bitter thing, to shoot in secret the undefiled.
/pst/They will shoot at him on a sudden, and will not fear: <v>\greheightstar</v> they are resolute in wickedness.
/pst/They have talked of hiding snares; <v>\greheightstar</v> they have said: Who shall see them?
/pst/They have searched after iniquities: <v>\greheightstar</v> they have failed in their search.
/pst/Man shall come to a deep heart: <v>\greheightstar</v> and God shall be exalted.
/pst/The arrows of children are their wounds: <v>\greheightstar</v> and their tongues against them are made weak.
/pst/All that saw them were troubled; <v>\greheightstar</v> and every man was afraid.
/pst/And they declared the works of God: <v>\greheightstar</v> and understood his doings.
/pst/The just shall rejoice in the Lord, and shall hope in him: <v>\greheightstar</v> and all the upright in heart shall be praised.
/tra/Ant. O all ye nations, behold and see my sorrow.
/tra/Ant. O Lord, deliver my soul <v>\greheightstar</v> from the gates of the grave.
/stt/Canticle of Ezechias
/ref/Isa 38:10-23
/pst/I said: In the midst of my days <v>\greheightstar</v> I shall go to the gates of hell:
/pst/I sought for the residue of my years. <v>\greheightstar</v> I said: I shall not see the Lord God in the land of the living.
/pst/I shall behold man no more, <v>\greheightstar</v> nor the inhabitant of rest.
/pst/My generation is at an end, and it is rolled away from me, <v>\greheightstar</v> as a shepherd’s tent.
/pst/My life is cut off, as by a weaver: whilst I was yet but beginning, he cut me off: <v>\greheightstar</v> from morning even to night thou wilt make an end of me.
/pst/I hoped till morning, <v>\greheightstar</v> as a lion so hath he broken all my bones:
/pst/From morning even to night thou wilt make an end of me. <v>\greheightstar</v> I will cry like a young swallow, I will meditate like a dove:
/pst/My eyes are weakened <v>\greheightstar</v> looking upward:
/pst/Lord, I suffer violence, answer thou for me. <v>\greheightstar</v> What shall I say, or what shall he answer for me, whereas he himself hath done it?
/pst/I will recount to thee all my years <v>\greheightstar</v> in the bitterness of my soul.
/pst/O Lord, if man’s life be such, and the life of my spirit be in such things as these, thou shalt correct me, and make me to live. <v>\greheightstar</v> Behold in peace is my bitterness most bitter:
/pst/But thou hast delivered my soul that it should not perish, <v>\greheightstar</v> thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back.
/pst/For hell shall not confess to thee, neither shall death praise thee: <v>\greheightstar</v> nor shall they that go down into the pit, look for thy truth.
/pst/The living, the living, he shall give praise to thee, as I do this day: <v>\greheightstar</v> the father shall make thy truth known to the children.
/pst/O Lord, save me, and we will sing our psalms all the days of our life <v>\greheightstar</v> in the house of the Lord.
/tra/Ant. O Lord, deliver my soul from the gates of the grave.
/tra/Ant. O all ye that pass by <v>\greheightstar</v> behold, and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow.
/sttps/Psalm 150
/pst1/Praise ye the Lord in his holy places: <v>\greheightstar</v> praise ye him in the firmament of his power.
/pst/Praise ye him for his mighty acts: <v>\greheightstar</v> praise ye him according to the multitude of his greatness.
/pst/Praise him with sound of trumpet: <v>\greheightstar</v> praise him with psaltery and harp.
/pst/Praise him with timbrel and choir: <v>\greheightstar</v> praise him with strings and organs.
/pst/Praise him on high sounding cymbals: praise him on cymbals of joy: <v>\greheightstar</v> let every spirit praise the Lord.
/tra/Ant. O all ye that pass by behold, and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow.

/stt/Canticle of Zacharias
/ref/Luke 1:68-79
/pst1/Blessed be the Lord ✠ God of Israel; <v>\greheightstar</v> because he hath visited and wrought the redemption of his people:
/pst/And hath raised up an horn of salvation to us, <v>\greheightstar</v> in the house of David his servant:
/pst/As he spoke by the mouth of his holy Prophets, <v>\greheightstar</v> who are from the beginning:
/pst/Salvation from our enemies, <v>\greheightstar</v> and from the hand of all that hate us:
/pst/To perform mercy to our fathers, <v>\greheightstar</v> and to remember his holy testament,
/pst/The oath, which he swore to Abraham our father, <v>\greheightstar</v> that he would grant to us,
/pst/That being delivered from the hand of our enemies, <v>\greheightstar</v> we may serve him without fear,
/pst/In holiness and justice before him, <v>\greheightstar</v> all our days.
/pst/And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: <v>\greheightstar</v> for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways:
/pst/To give knowledge of salvation to his people, <v>\greheightstar</v> unto the remission of their sins:
/pst/Through the bowels of the mercy of our God, <v>\greheightstar</v> in which the Orient from on high hath visited us:
/pst/To enlighten them that sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death: <v>\greheightstar</v> to direct our feet into the way of peace.
/tra/Ant. There were women sitting over against the sepulchre weeping, and making lamentation for the Lord.
